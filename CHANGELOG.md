## [v1.0.9] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **Cross-org secret passing** — replaced `secrets: inherit` in `bootstrap.yml`,
  `terraform-init.yml`, and `terraform-job.yml` with explicit secret lists.
  GitHub cannot re-export inherited secrets across organization boundaries;
  callers from outside `innofactororg` would silently receive empty secrets.

- **State blob subdirectory creation** — `terraform-init.yml` now runs
  `mkdir -p "$(dirname ...)"` before downloading a state blob whose
  `state_name` contains a subdirectory prefix (e.g. `test/terraform.tfstate`).

- **`var_path` resolution after `cd`** — the terraform step changes directory
  to `src/<code_path>` before running. `var_path` is now resolved from the
  workspace root (`${start_path}/src/<var_path>`) so it is not accidentally
  re-rooted under the new working directory.

- **`terraform show -json` stderr isolation** — plan JSON is now generated
  inside the terraform step (while providers are still initialized) with stderr
  redirected to a separate log file and validated with `jq empty`, preventing
  provider warnings from corrupting the JSON consumed by infracost.

- **`containers_list` in backup instance policy** — `terraform-init.yml`
  correctly patches `containers_list` in the BlobBackupDatasourceParameters
  JSON (not the deprecated `containers_backup_friendly_names` field).

- **`jq -c` + quoted echo in terraform-init.yml** — compact `jq` output and
  a properly quoted `echo` prevent newlines from being mangled in the
  `bvi_request` JSON payload.

### Changed

- **Infracost: blob-storage run-to-run baseline** — the infracost step now
  stores the absolute cost breakdown (`infracost-abs.json`) in the plan blob
  container after each plan run, and downloads the previous run's breakdown as
  the `--compare-to` baseline on the next run. This replaces the previous
  approach of re-running `infracost breakdown` against the git `main` checkout,
  which produced false cost deltas on repos with multiple `.tfvars` files
  (infracost auto-detects each file as a separate project, causing spurious
  add/remove rows). Using `--path=plan.json` for both runs guarantees
  consistent project names and accurate deltas.

- **`var_path` input description** — clarified that `var_path` is relative to
  the repository root (same convention as `code_path`), and that it defaults
  to `code_path` (tfvars alongside .tf files). For multi-environment repos,
  set it to the environment-specific subdirectory.
