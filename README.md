# Terraform workflow

A reusable workflow to perform Terraform operations like plan and apply.

This workflow is designed to trigger on either a `pull request` or a
pull request `comment`.

When triggered by a `pull request`, a terraform plan is created.

When triggered by a `comment`, the workflow will inspect the comment and
act on specific commands, as [listed below](#commands).

The comment can include more than one command, each on a separate line,
that will be executed in the order that they are specified.

To include additional text in the comment, add three number signs (###)
after the commands and on a separate line. The text will then be
preserved in the comment.

## Commands

<!-- no toc -->
* [/plan](#terraform-plan)
* [/apply](#terraform-apply)
* [/force-unlock](#terraform-force-unlock)
* [/graph](#terraform-graph)
* [/import](#terraform-import)
* [/state list](#terraform-state-list)
* [/state mv](#terraform-state-mv)
* [/state rm](#terraform-state-rm)
* [/state show](#terraform-state-show)
* [/untaint](#terraform-untaint)
* [/scan](#security-scan)

Each command can have additional arguments. The arguments must be placed
after the command, separated by a space, and must be valid terraform
arguments. The following arguments will not be passed on:

`-no-color`
`-input=false`
`-out=FILENAME`
`-auto-approve`
`-detailed-exitcode`

Example:

```text
/import module.csoc_solution.module.resource_groups["p-sec-mon"].azurerm_resource_group.rg /subscriptions/64499dc8-d437-45d7-8d2e-4910e88e17b2/resourceGroups/p-sec-mon
/import module.csoc_solution.module.resource_groups["p-sec-auto"].azurerm_resource_group.rg /subscriptions/64499dc8-d437-45d7-8d2e-4910e88e17b2/resourceGroups/p-sec-auto
/plan
/apply

### Comment

Import two existing resource groups before update and apply the plan.
```

## Security scan

The scan command will generate a
[tfsec sarif file](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec-sarif-action)
and upload the file to the job artifacts and to
[GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security).

The job will fail if GitHub Advanced Security is not enabled in
the organization.

## Terraform plan

Generate a terraform plan based on the terraform (.tf) files and
configuration (.tfvars) included in the branch.

This command is automatically triggered by a pull request, including
new commits to an existing pull request.

To trigger it manually, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/plan [options]`

Example:

`/plan -destroy -target=module.csoc_solution.module.resource_groups["p-sec-mon"].azurerm_resource_group.rg`

### Terraform plan options

* `-destroy` - Creates a plan whose goal is to destroy all remote objects
that currently exist, leaving an empty terraform state.
* `-refresh-only` - Refresh-only mode creates a plan whose goal is only to
update the terraform state and any root module output values to match
changes made to remote objects outside of terraform. This can be useful
if you've intentionally changed one or more remote objects outside of the
usual workflow (e.g. while responding to an incident) and you now need to
reconcile terraform's records with those changes.
* `-refresh=false` - Disable the default behavior of synchronizing the
terraform state with remote objects before checking for configuration
changes. Can be `true` or `false`.
* `-replace=ADDRESS` - Instructs Terraform to plan to replace the resource
instance with the given address.
* `-target=ADDRESS` - Instructs Terraform to focus its planning efforts
only on resource instances which match the given address and on any objects
that those instances depend on.

## Terraform apply

This command executes the actions proposed in a saved terraform
plan (saved plan mode).

If the plan is successfully applied, the pull request will be merged with
it's target branch and the pull request branch will be deleted.
This behavior can be customized with the input parameters merge_method
and keep_branch_after_merge.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/apply`

## Terraform force-unlock

This command removes the lock on the state for the current configuration.
This will not modify the infrastructure.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/force-unlock LOCK_ID`

Example:

`/force-unlock 40e844a6-ebb0-fcfd-da85-5cce5bd1ec89`

## Terraform graph

Generate a visual representation of either a configuration or
execution plan.

The output of terraform graph is in the DOT format, which can be
converted to an image by making use of dot provided by
[GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/graph [options]`

Example:

`/graph -type=apply`

### Terraform graph options

* `-type=TYPE` - Type of graph to output. Can be:
`plan`, `plan-destroy`, `apply`, `validate`, `input`, `refresh`.
* `-draw-cycles` - Highlight any cycles in the graph with colored edges.
This helps when diagnosing cycle errors.

The `-type` flag can be used to control the type of graph shown.
Terraform creates different graphs for different operations.
The default type is `plan` if type option is not given. If the `apply`
type is given, the saved plan file is passed as an argument.

## Terraform import

Import will find the existing resource from `ID` and import it into
terraform state at the given `ADDRESS`.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/import ADDRESS ID`

Example:

`/import module.csoc_solution.module.resource_groups["p-sec-mon"].azurerm_resource_group.rg /subscriptions/64499dc8-d437-45d7-8d2e-4910e88e17b2/resourceGroups/p-sec-mon`

## Terraform state list

List all resources in the state file matching the given addresses (if any).
If no addresses are given, all resources are listed.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/state list [options] [ADDRESS...]`

### Terraform state list options

`-id=id` - ID of resources to show.

## Terraform state mv

Terraform will look in the current state for a resource instance,
resource, or module that matches the given address, and if successful
it will move the remote objects currently associated with the source
to be tracked instead by the destination.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/state mv [options] SOURCE DESTINATION`

### Terraform state mv options

`-dry-run` - Report all of the resource instances that match the given
address without actually "moving" any of them.

## Terraform state rm

Terraform will search the state for any instances matching the given
resource address, and remove the record of each one so that Terraform
will no longer be tracking the corresponding remote objects.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/state rm [options] ADDRESS...`

### Terraform state rm options

`-dry-run` - Report all of the resource instances that match the given
address without actually "forgetting" any of them.

## Terraform state show

The command will show the attributes of a single resource in the state
file that matches the given address.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/state show ADDRESS`

## Terraform untaint

Terraform has a marker which it uses to track that an object might be
damaged and so a future terraform plan ought to replace it.

Terraform automatically marks an object as tainted if an error occurs
during a multi-step create action, because Terraform can't be sure that
the object was left in a fully-functional state.

If Terraform currently considers a particular object as tainted but
you've determined that it's actually functioning correctly and need not
be replaced, you can use terraform untaint to remove the taint marker
from that object.

This command will not modify any real remote objects, but will modify
the state in order to remove the tainted status.

To trigger this command, comment on the pull request page and use
the following format:

`/untaint [options] ADDRESS`

The ADDRESS argument is a terraform resource address identifying a
particular resource instance which is currently tainted.

Example:

`/untaint module.csoc_solution.module.resource_groups["p-sec-mon"].azurerm_resource_group.rg`

### Terraform untaint options

* `-allow-missing` - Succeed even if the resource is missing.
